5.1 Exercise
You have a class NotificationService with a void method sendAlert(String message). 
This method sends an alert message to an operations team. The sending process 
involves two steps: validating the message and then sending it through an alerting mechanism. 
If the message is null or empty, a custom InvalidAlertException should be thrown.

public class NotificationService {
    private AlertGateway gateway;

    public NotificationService(AlertGateway gateway) {
        this.gateway = gateway;
    }

    public void sendAlert(String message) {
        if (message == null || message.trim().isEmpty()) {
            throw new InvalidAlertException("Alert message is invalid");
        }
        gateway.send(message);
    }
}


Task:

Write a Mockito-based unit test for the sendAlert method that verifies the following:

The send method on the gateway is called with the correct message when sendAlert is invoked with a valid message.

An InvalidAlertException is thrown when sendAlert is invoked with a null message.

The send method on the gateway is never called when an InvalidAlertException is thrown.
